The following steps describe a typical workflow of connecting Pleo with an ERP or accounting system:

1. In the Pleo application, click **Settings**.
2. Click **Accounting**.
3. Search for the ERP or the accounting system that you want to integrate with.
4. Click the specific ERP or the accounting system and then click **Connect**. Based on the ERP or the accounting system that you select, the connection procedure varies. For example, if you want to integrate Pleo with Xero, the log in page to Xero appears.

## Deployment of Pleo Integration with ERP/Accounting System

You have the following options for the integration deployment:

* **Module or on-premises**: Some ERP and accounting systems provide a platform for deployment of the integration in their environment. For example, NetSuite and SAP B1. This method has the following benefits:

  * The integration utilises the ERP/accounting system provided platform, ensuring higher stability and connectivity.
  * The integration could use the platform tech stack for building the configuration procedure.
  * There is only a single step of authorisation required to access data from Pleo.
    <Info />

* **Deployment on Cloud Platform**: The integration is deployed on a cloud platform. Hence, when you connect Pleo with the third-party application, the following occurs:

  1. The cloud platform specific configuration page appears.
  2. Complete the integration process here - authenticate and authorise the integration for data transition between Pleo and the ERP/accounting system.
