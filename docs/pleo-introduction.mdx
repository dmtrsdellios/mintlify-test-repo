# Overview

Pleo is an expense management solution that helps your organisation with all aspects of business spending. We help you to simplify expense reporting and automate financial workflows; thus saving your time and effort in managing and bookkeeping accounting entries. A few benefits are highlighted here:

* **Employees purchasing directly with your company specific Pleo cards**: This streamlines your business spending - you can set spending limits and every incurred expense is reviewed to verify that all details are appropriately included and conforms with company spending guidelines. In addition, the process of incurring expenses from personal wallet and then submitting the expenses for reimbursement is cumbersome as it makes the process lengthy and could lead to unnecessary delays.\
  With Pleo, you can eliminate any risk of overspending and also detect any missing expense information. Hence, you get accurate real-time accounting analytics.

* **A centralised platform to manage all types of expenses**: In Pleo, you can manage all kinds of expenses, including reimbursements, allowances, subscription payments, and work-related travelling cost; for example, reimbursements for out of pocket expenses that your employees have incurred. Processing payments for any expense is now easier and faster as you spend less time and resources on reconciliation.\
  The only clause - the expenses are legitimate as per your company policy. The process is simple:

  1. Expenses submitted.
  2. Expenses reviewed and approved.
  3. Payments processed.

* **Integrate Pleo with other Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems/ Accounting software and Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS)**: You can integrate Pleo with most ERP and accounting systems, providing you a seamless transition of accounting data from Pleo to your primary accounting software. This helps you to synchronise expenses across multiple systems and thus, empowering you to improve budget allocations, financial policy amendments, and revision of work policies.\
  Similarly, integration of Pleo with HRIS implies improved user management - provisioning Pleo cards for your new employees is an easy procedure, while deactivating the existing Pleo cards for your former users is also a simple task.

## How Customers Use Pleo?

Here is a step by step procedure on how customers can leverage Pleo. For your understanding, the workflow is divided into two phases:

**First phase**:

1. **Onboarding**: Customers configure their Pleo account.

2. **Integrating with ERP/Accounting Systems**:

   1. Integrate Pleo with the ERP/Accounting System.
   2. Authenticate and authorise the integration.

3. **Pleo account configuration**: Configure the accounting data in Pleo to match with the third-party accounting software. For more information, see [Configuring Customer Account in Pleo](/v0.2/docs/configuring-customer-account-in-pleo).

4. **Pleo wallet top up**: Add funds to the Pleo wallet. This helps customers to process all payments through their Pleo account.

5. **Addition of Employees**:

   1. Add employees to their Pleo account.
   2. Issue virtual and physical Pleo cards to their employees.

**Second Phase: Expense Review and Accounting Data Export**:

As employees spend with their Pleo cards, submit out-of-pocket expenses for reimbursement, or pay invoices, data is captured in Pleo.

1. Each expense moves through a workflow of data gathering and approvals.
2. Once the data collection is complete and an expense is approved, it is ready for export to the ERP/accounting system.
   <Warning />
3. The data is exported from Pleo into the accounting system. Based on the specific business needs, the data export to the ERP/accounting system could be scheduled at different intervals. Once an accounting entry is exported to the accounting software, it is **archived** in Pleo and is locked from further editing.
