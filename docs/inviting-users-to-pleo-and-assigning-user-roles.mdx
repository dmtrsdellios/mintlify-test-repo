## User Roles in Pleo

In an organisation, Pleo caters to different user roles, including the following:

| User Role          | Supported or Not | Privileges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Adding Employees to Pleo

You can add your employees to Pleo and assign different permissions based on the activity they would perform in Pleo. There are two ways to add your employees:

* Add employees in Pleo.
* Import employees from the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) that you have integrated with.

You can also add a Pleo specific **employee code** to map the employee details with the record existing in the HRIS or ERP system.

### Adding Employees in Pleo

Perform the following to add employees in Pleo:

1. In the Pleo application, click **People**.
2. On the **People** page, click **Add People**.
3. Enter the email address of the employee and click **Continue**.
4. Select the appropriate card access that you want to provide to this employee:

* **Card only**: Select this option if the employee needs a Pleo card for all business spending.
* **Card and Reimbursements**: Select this option if the employee needs a Pleo card for all business spending and might submit out-of-pocket expenses for reimbursements.
* **Reimbursements only**: Select this option if the employee would only submit out-of-pocket expenses for reimbursements.

### Assigning User Roles to Employees

If you have **Admin** rights, you can assign user permissions to employees, based on the responsibilities they would perform. For more information see [Assigning User Roles to Employees](https://help.pleo.io/en/support/solutions/articles/103000254557-how-to-change-user-roles).
