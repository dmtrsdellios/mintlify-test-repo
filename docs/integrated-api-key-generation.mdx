You can generate integrated API keys while you are connecting your Pleo account with an application that is already existing in the list of Pleo supported integrations.

<Info />

## Characteristics of Integrated API Keys:

* The API key is generated during the integration process and hence, it includes the permissions required to successfully authenticate the integration.
* Although the integrated API keys are closely connected to the integrations for which they are generated, yet they can be used, in general, to manage your Pleo account in order to protect the confidentiality and security of your business.
* You can see them as part of the list of API keys generated in the past on the **Settings > API Keys** page.

## How to Generate an Integrated API Key?

**Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance** is selected here as an example.

1. In the Pleo application, go to **Settings**.
2. Click **Accounting**.
3. Click **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance** as the application that you want to integrate with your Pleo account.
