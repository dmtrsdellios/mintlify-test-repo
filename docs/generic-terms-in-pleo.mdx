Funds can be added, converted, or withdrawn from the Pleo account. We support multi-currency configuration — customers can have multiple accounts with Pleo in six different currencies. |
| Card Payments                | Payments are made with the Pleo card, using funds from the Pleo wallet. This is at the company/organisation level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Contra Accounts              | Accounts in the ERP/accounting system corresponding to the Pleo accounts. Out of Pocket expenses and Reimbursements indicate the amount in a Pleo account that a company/organisation owes to its employees.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Cash Withdrawals             | Employees of a company or an organisation might withdraw cash with their Pleo card. This is recorded as an employee's liability to the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Account in Chart of Accounts | The chart of accounts is the customer's index of all financial accounts maintained in an ERP/accounting system. Hence, an account in the chart of accounts is the source or the destination of money — it could be a real physical entity (like a bank account) or a virtual account (like a pocket account).                                                                                          |
