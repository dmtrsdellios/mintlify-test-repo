| Export Item      | An accounting entry that has been transformed into an exportable entry. The required accounting and bookkeeping information is aggregated from an accounting entry to become an export item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Export Job       | An export job is the task that manages the export workflow, comprising the export items that are selected for export from Pleo to the external ERP/accounting system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Export Job Event | The export job events cause change in status of an export job; when an event is triggered, the status of the corresponding export job is impacted. This is returned in the `status` parameter of the export-jobs endpoint. For example, when a specific export job has failed, an export job event is triggered with failed value for the event parameter; the reason of failure is also mentioned to understand what caused the problem and how it could be resolved. |
| Export Job Item  | An export job item tracks the export progress of a specific accounting entry in an export job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
