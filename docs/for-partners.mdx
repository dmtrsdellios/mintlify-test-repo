You can generate standalone API keys when you want to integrate your Pleo account with custom applications (applications that are not listed as part of available integrations).

<Info>
  Our APIs are in the Early Access Program (EAP) stage and hence, we are unable to provide access to all customers. Please speak with our customer support team if you require API keys to connect with our APIs and build custom accounting integrations.
</Info>

1. In the Pleo application, go to **Settings**.
2. Click **API Keys**. The **API Keys** page appears.
3. Click **Create API Key**.
4. Enter the following details:

* **Name**: An appropriate name for the API key you are generating.
* **Expiration**: Specify a date until when you want the API key to be active.
* **Access Level**: Specify whether you want the API key for a specific entity (company) or for multiple entities of a business (organisation).
* **Permissions**: Select the check boxes next to the scopes you require. Based on your selection, the scopes are enabled in the API key generated at the end of this procedure. The API key is generated. Copy the API key for future reference.
