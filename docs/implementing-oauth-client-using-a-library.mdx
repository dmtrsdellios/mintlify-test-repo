Many open source libraries offer high-quality implementations of OAuth clients. They are available in a variety of programming languages, offering support for various web frameworks and database backends.

<Info>
  A list of open-source OAuth client libraries is available at [https://oauth.net/code/](https://oauth.net/code/).
</Info>

We strongly recommend using one of these libraries instead of implementing OAuth from scratch. Examples are:

* **Java**: spring-security-oauth2-client, Apache OLTu
* **Python**: authlib, Requests-OAuthlib
* **JavaScript**: passport.js, oidc-client-js
* **.NET**: Microsoft.Identity.Web

## Implementing OAuth Client Using a Library

Libraries providing OAuth implementation often allow customisation to some extent - allow to plug in custom implementations for front-end and back-end interfaces they provide.

Most often, when using a library, a developer can:

Benefits of using a library:

* Configure the client with specific authorisation server: provide the authorisation and token endpoints, configure supported client authentication methods, and protocol extensions.
* Provide the User Interface (UI) for initiating the authentication flow (**connect to Pleo** button), and connect it to functions and methods of the library that generate all necessary authentication request parameters.
* Integrate the library with the web framework of choice to allow it to perform HTTP redirects.
* Provide implementation for persistence backend, allowing the client library to store and retrieve parameters, such as `code_verifier` and `state`. Also, generate access and refresh tokens.
* Provide custom UI for handling success and error responses from the authorisation server.
* Listen to events emitted during flow and extend various stages.
