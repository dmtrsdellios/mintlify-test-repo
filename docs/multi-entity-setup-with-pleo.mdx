## Difference between Company and Organisation

| Company                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Organisation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| A single entity of a business, identified by a `company_id` maintained in Pleo. For example, a company named Alexey Software has a single entity and operates from a single location, the United Kingdom. | Multiple entities of a business, identified by `organisation_id` maintained in Pleo. For example, Love Creme Brulee is an organisation that has multiple subsidiaries and operates in different regions of Europe - Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. The organisation Love Creme Brulee is assigned an `organisation_id` and each entity is assigned a `company_id`. An admin of Love Creme Brulee would have the privileges to view details of each entity. |

## How Pleo Supports Organisations?

We have implemented **multi-entity support** for organisations to optimally use Pleo as their spend management platform; a single Pleo account might have multiple entities with the following:

* Different accounting entries for each entity
* Different employees and vendors for each entity
* Different integrations for each entity

## Company and Organisation Specific Integrations

* **Third-party ERP/accounting** integrations with Pleo could be connected at the company level, implying `company_id` is used when connecting a Pleo account with a third-party ERP/accounting application.
* For **HRIS/user-management** integrations, the Pleo account could be connected both at organisation and company levels. If a business has only a single entity, HRIS integrations for this specific customer are done at the company level.
