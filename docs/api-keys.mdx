Another form of authorisation that Pleo supports is API keys and this form of authorisation is applicable, when:

* You are integrating Pleo with another application that does not support OAuth, for example, the applications that are deployed on-premises and these applications would also be included in the list of integration offerings that Pleo supports.
* You are a customer (company or organisation) interested in building a custom or bespoke integration with Pleo or temporarily ingest data from Pleo.

<Info />

You can generate two types of API keys:

* [Standalone API keys](/docs/for-partners): Generate **standalone API keys** when you want to integrate your Pleo account with bespoke applications.
* [Integrated API keys](/docs/integrated-api-key-generation): During the installation process of connecting your Pleo account with an application that is already existing in the list of supported integrations, the API keys that you generate are **integrated API keys**.
