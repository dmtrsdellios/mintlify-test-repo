| Pocket Expenses  | Out of Pocket Expenses | Employees of a company or an organisation have incurred work related expenses using their personal funds. This is a liability of the employer to the employees. These expenses typically cover various small office supplies, client dinners, or urgent costs not covered by company cards.                                                                                                                     | `out_of_pocket`            | An employee of your company buys office supplies, such as pens and notebooks worth €30, during a business trip at a local store where they do not accept any company card. The employee then submits this pocket expense claim with a receipt through Pleo for reimbursement.                                                                                     |
| Pocket Expenses  | Mileage                | Mileage tracking is for employees who use their personal vehicles for business-related travel. Instead of reimbursing fuel costs directly, companies often reimburse a standard rate per kilometre or mile driven for work purposes.                                                                                                                                                                            | `mileage`                  | Your employee drives 100 kilometres to attend a business conference. Using Pleo’s mileage tracking feature, they record the trip to later get reimbursed at the company’s rate of €0.40 per kilometre, totalling €40.                                                                                                                                             |
| Pocket Expenses  | Per Diem               | Per Diem refers to a daily allowance provided to employees to cover daily expenses such as meals and incidental costs while travelling for business. This is usually a fixed amount set by the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `per_diem`                 | Your employee is sent on a three-day business trip. Your company provides a per diem of €50 per day to cover all meal and incidental expenses. Over three days, they receive a total of €150.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Reimbursements   | Direct Reimbursements  | Reimbursement made directly to the employees' bank accounts/cards for business expenses incurred with personal funds. The reimbursements are paid from the company/organisation's Pleo wallet, impacting the Pleo wallet balance and the out-of-pocket balance.                                                                                                                                                 | `direct_reimbursements`    | An employee paid for a client's dinner from her own pocket and now gets this money back to her personal bank card. The money was taken from Pleo Wallet.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Reimbursement    | External Reimbursement | Reimbursement made to employees with their salary or in cash, impacting only the out-of-pocket balance. This is managed outside Pleo and does not impact the company/organisation's Pleo wallet balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `external_reimbusement`    | Your employees have paid for client's dinners from their own pocket and now gets this money back to their personal bank cards.

| Wallet Transfers | Wallet Topup           | Transfer of funds to the Pleo wallet of a company/organisation from its bank account or other financial sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `wallet_topup`             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Wallet Transfers | Wallet Unload          | Wallet Unload involves transferring excess funds from the Pleo wallet back to the company’s main bank account or another financial repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `wallet_unload`            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Other            | ATM Withdrawal         | Employees withdrawing cash at Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) using their Pleo cards. Since Pleo cannot control how an employee uses the withdrawn money, we consider ATM\_withdrawals as an employee taking this company money for personal use. This has an implication on how we typically book ATM withdrawals.                                                                                            | `atm_withdrawal`           | An employee of your company is on a business trip to a region where card usage is limited and cash payments are more common. They use their Pleo card to withdraw €200 from an ATM to cover meals and local transportation expenses during the trip. The withdrawal is logged as an ATM withdrawal expense in Pleo.                                               |
| Other            | Personal Spend         | Employees of a company/organisation have accidentally used their Pleo card for personal expenses, mistakenly or on purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `personal_spend`           | Employees of your company use their Pleo cards to pay for personal grocery bills amounting to €50. They mark the transaction as personal spend in the Pleo app. However, since the employees have previously paid for business expenses from their pocket, this expense would not be deducted from their salaries.                                                |
| Other            | Cashback               | Pleo offers rewards to companies/organisations for using Pleo as their spend management platform. This reward is a small % of the amount spent which Pleo customers get back into their Pleo Wallet. This is similar to regular banks who sometimes offer cashback for using their credit card. However, there are specific eligibility criteria for being companies/organisations to be eligible for cashback. | `cashback`                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
