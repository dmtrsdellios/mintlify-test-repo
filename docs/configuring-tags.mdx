Tags imply cost centres. So when you assign tags to an accounting entry, it helps in allocating the correct cost centre to an accounting entry. For example, an expense of the **Flight** category is recorded in Pleo. This specific accounting entry is assigned the **Business Trip** tag. Assignment of tags helps in assessment of cost incurred for specific reasons.

A few important characteristics of **Tags**:

* A **Tag Group** is like a collection of tags. For example, a tag group is a **Department** and it includes **Sales**, **Marketing**, and **IT**. Each individual value is a tag; hence, **Sales**, **Marketing**, or **IT** is a tag indicating a specific department.

  * Tag Group = Dimension Group
  * Tag = Dimension value Hence, each tag is like adding a dimension to the Tag Group/Dimension Group. And the display order of the dimension values are indicated by the number assigned to each dimension value.

* Each tag group and tag have specific IDs assigned to them in Pleo for easy identification.

* You can either create new tags in Pleo or you can import tags from the ERP/accounting system that you have integrated with. In addition, you can also import tags from an excel spreadsheet, enabling customers to track the types and volumes of expenses recorded in Pleo based on the tags assignment.

* You can assign a maximum of five tags to an accounting entry.

You can set up tags either using the Tags API or in the Pleo application:

* To set up tags using the Tags API, see the [Tags API](/reference/about-tags).

* To set up tags in the Pleo application, perform the following in the **Settings** > **Accounting** > **Tags** tab:

  * Click **Create tag group**.

  * Enter a name for your tag group and then click **Create tag group**.

  * Under **Tags**, specify the individual dimension values that you would like to add. For example, **Workplace Management** tag group might contain location specific tags as relevant for the customer's business operations.
