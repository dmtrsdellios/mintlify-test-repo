# API Deprecation Notice

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and innovate our product offerings, we have decided to deprecate a number of API endpoints from Pleo’s API (now referred to collectively as the Legacy API). The legacy methods will be replaced by new methods over the coming months.

We understand that this change may impact your current workflow, and we want to assure you that we are committed to providing the support you need during this transition. Here are the key details and dates to keep in mind:

* **Deprecation Date:** Effective immediately, the Legacy API is considered deprecated. This means that while the API will remain operational until the end-of-life date, no new features will be added, and only critical security updates and bug fixes will be provided.
* **End-of-Life Date:** After this date, the API endpoints will no longer respond to requests.
* **Migration Support:** We are dedicated to helping you migrate to the new API. Over the next few months, we will be providing documentation, support, and tools to facilitate your transition. Further information on the migration path for each use case is provided below.
* **Action Required:** If you are currently using the Legacy API, we recommend beginning the process of migrating your systems as soon as possible. Please review any integrations or applications that depend on the Legacy API and plan accordingly.

## Migration Plans

If your implementation of the Pleo API is for any of the following use cases, find more information about how these functions will be supported going forward.
