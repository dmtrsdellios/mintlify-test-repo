## Multi-Currency in Export API

`contraAccount` object is returned in the endpoint response of `GET https://external.pleo.io/v3/export-items`, when the expense is any of the following types and it impacts the account balance:

* `card_purchase`
* `fee`
* `cashback`
* `refund`
* `chargeback`
* `direct_reimbursement`
* `invoice_payment`
* `card_invoice`
* `atm_withdrawal`
* `personal_spend`
* `wallet_topup`
* `wallet_unload`

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. If a customer has enabled multi-currency, can they still access the Export API version 2? No, the version 2 `GET Get Export Items` endpoint returns `400: Bad Request` error and displays the following:

   ```
   {
   "type": "UNSUPPORTED_API_VERSION",
   "message": "Upgrade to Export API v3 or higher: The API version you are trying to access does not support multi-currency wallets."
   }
   ```

   This ensures accurate bookkeeping, as when multi-currency configuration is enabled, the integration must access the Export API version 3 for the correct export of accounting entries from Pleo to the external ERP/accounting system.

2. Can an integration send a request to the Export API version 3 if multi-currency is not enabled? No, the version 3 `GET Get Export Items` endpoint returns `400: Bad Request` error and displays the following:

   ```
   {
   "type": "missing_contra_accounts",
   "message": "Contra accounts are not fully configured. Please map contra accounts in the Accounting settings."
   }
   ```

3. What happens to an `in_progress` export job when `400: Bad Request` is returned in the `GET Get Export Items` endpoint? You can configure the integration to either fail the corresponding export job or wait until it expires.
