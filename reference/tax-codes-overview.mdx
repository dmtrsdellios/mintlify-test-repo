Tax codes are used to calculate the tax for each expense for proper reporting.

A tax code can be linked to a category (type of spend defined by the user), so all spend classified within this category would have a tax code attached to it. However, a category can have multiple tax codes associated with it, but a default code can be selected for the specific category. This means — when a spender selects a category for the expense, the default code is also selected.

As part of expense review process, before exporting from Pleo, a bookkeeper might change the tax code manually — if the default tax code is incorrect or if the expense needs multiple tax rates according to the line items of the purchase.
