<Warning />

This API enables you to synchronise the list of vendor records, applicable for your business, between the external ERP/accounting system and Pleo. This is crucial as this enables you to tag specific vendors to accounting entries, helping you in assessing the amount of expenses incurred per vendor.

## What is a Vendor?

A vendor is an individual or business entity that sells goods or services to customers.

## Vendor Synchronisation between Pleo and ERP/Accounting System

This is how vendor records are synchronised between Pleo and the ERP/accounting system:

* For importing vendors from the ERP/accounting system to Pleo — the integration sends a request for each individual record to the `POST Create a New Vendor` endpoint.
* Whenever, a new vendor is created in the accounting application, the integration sends a request to the `POST Create a New Vendor` endpoint — this creates the corresponding record in Pleo.

<Info />

* If and when any updates are made to a vendor account in the accounting application, the integration sends a request to the `PUT Update a Vendor` endpoint. This ensures that the vendor records in both the accounting system and Pleo are always in sync.
* When any vendor is inactivated or deleted in the ERP/accounting system — the integrations sends a request to `POST Archive a Vendor` endpoint; the status is changed to `archive` state in Pleo.
  <Info />
* Similarly, when any vendor is unarchived and set to the `active` status in the ERP/accounting system — a request is sent to the `POST Marks a Vendor as active` endpoint. This activates the vendor record in Pleo.

<Info />

### Vendor Creation in Pleo

You can also create a new vendor in Pleo without the record existing in the ERP/accounting system — send a manual request to the `POST Create a New Vendor` endpoint. The vendor is created in `Draft` state as the corresponding record is not yet present in the client; also, the `code` identifier is missing in this stage as it is assigned to each record by the ERP/accounting system. A webhook event `v1.vendor.created` is generated and a notification is sent to the integration. Once the record is created in the ERP system, the integration sends a request to the `POST Marks a Vendor as Active` endpoint — this changes the `Draft` state to `Active` and also assigns a unique `code` to the record.

## Vendor API Functions

The Vendor API allows you to perform various operations related to vendors, such as creating, retrieving, updating, archiving, and activating vendors. Each vendor is identified by a unique `code` that is assigned by the external application. Pleo also assigns an `id` to each record for internal identification.

When an accounting entry is linked to a vendor, it helps to bookkeep the accounting entry to the correct vendor in the external accounting system.

## Webhook Notification

When any vendor is created in Pleo (the record is not yet existing in the ERP/accounting system), a webhook event `v1.vendor.created` is triggered. If the integration has subscribed to this event, a notification is sent to the configured endpoint.
