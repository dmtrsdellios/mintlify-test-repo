## API Keys

The Pleo API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Pleo UI in "Settings"

<Warning>
  Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
</Warning>

Create your individual **Open API Token** with the steps below:

1. Open the Pleo web app and go to your Settings

2. Click on Open API

3. Click on Create token in the top right corner
