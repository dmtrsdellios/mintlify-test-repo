<Warning />

## Backwards Incompatible

Then backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new, dated version is released. Read our API upgrades guide to see our API changelog and to learn more about backwards compatibility.

<Warning>
  All requests use your account API settings, unless you override the API version. The changelog lists every available version. Note that by default webhook events are structured according to your account API version, unless you set an API version during endpoint creation.
