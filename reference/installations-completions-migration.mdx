# Migrating from /completions to /me:activate

The `PUT /installations/completions` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the `POST /installations/me:activate` endpoint. The new endpoint works exactly the same way as the old one, but it is more consistent with the other endpoints, and compliant with the Pleo API Standard.

## Migration Guide

1. Replace the `PUT /installations/completions` endpoint with the `POST /installations/me:activate` endpoint.
2. Ensure the OAuth access token is included in the request `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header.
3. Done
