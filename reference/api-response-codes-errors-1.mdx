title: "API Response Codes | Errors"
description: "Pleo uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success and failure of API requests."
---

In general, codes in the`2xx` range indicate `Success`; the request is successfully received, understood, and accepted. Whereas, codes in the `4xx` range indicate a client error — the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. Errors in the `5xx` indicate a server error — the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request. For generic knowledge on the status code, see this [topic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/).

Here is a generic list of error codes and what they imply in the context of Pleo:

| 401  | The client's request is unauthorised. This may occur for any of the following reasons:- The JWT token has expired.
- The token that you have used is in the wrong format
- You are using an incorrect token.
- You have entered any token in the authorisation header. | * You must get a new JWT token for accessing the Export API resources.
* Verify the token format.
* Use the correct refresh token
* Check whether you have entered the token in the authorisation header. | - If the token has expired, initiate a new authorisation request.
